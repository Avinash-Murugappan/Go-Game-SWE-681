# Go Game 
- As part of a team, we developed a board game that can be played securely over a TCP/IP network <br>
- Our solution involved user authentication, data encryption using SSL / TSL protocol checking for software
and security vulnerabilities using tools like PMD, OWSAP ZAP, and also monitoring the legality of game moves.
